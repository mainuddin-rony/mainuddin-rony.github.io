		  <li><h3>Examining the Role of Clickbait Headlines to Engage Readers with Reliable Health-related Information (co-authored)</h3>
		  	<ul>
		  		<li style="font-size: 18px">
		  			Clickbait is a powerful tool to attract readers' attention. Although many people take clickbait in a negative connotation, this work proposes to explore the potentiality of using clickbait techniques to create more engagement of reliable health-related news articles.
		  		</li>
		  		<li style="font-size: 18px">
		  			The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11214.pdf">proposal</a> has been accepted in <a href="https://ai-for-socialgood.github.io/">2019 AAAI Fall Symposium: AI for Social Good Program</a>.

		  <li><h3>Varying amounts of information in health news headlines can affect user selection and interactivity (co-authored)</h3>
		  	<ul>
		  		<li style="font-size: 18px">This study examines the effects of varying amounts of key information presented in health news headlines on readers' engagement. The exploratory analysis founds that headlines with the most information are selected significantly more often than the headlines with less information. Moreover, the study concludes that readers mainly select low-informative headlines out of curiosity.</li>

		  <li><h3>Does the Headline Style Affect User Selection? An Exploratory Study on Health News (co-authored)</h3>
		  	<ul>
		  		<li style="font-size: 18px">This study examines the role of different linguistic styles presented in health news headlines to create user engagement. Out of many interesting findings of this study, one is the lack of effectiveness of the headlines containing questions despite they seem to be more interesting to the readers.</li>

		  <li><h3>I found this on Facebook/Twitter: Use of Social Media as Source</h3>
		  	<ul>
		  		<li style="font-size: 18px">
		  			This <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rNl0ni-gmffZ0-mwyN6mo2twxPyD2mLz/view?usp=sharing">poster</a> is presented in the <a href="https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/2-pacss/">2nd annual Politics and Computational Social Science (PaCSS) conference</a>. The use of social media as a news source is increasing over the years. This study explored to what extent mainstream and unreliable news media organizations use social media as a news source and found significant differences between them.
		  		</li>
		  		<li style="font-size: 18px">
		  			I also presented this poster in <a href="https://languagescience.umd.edu/events/language-science-day-2019">Language Science Day 2019</a> at University of Maryland.

		  <li><h3>Headline Incongruency: Computational Challenges and Future Directions</h3>
		  	<ul><li style="font-size: 18px">
		  		Headline incongruency is one type of information disorder where the headline of a news article doesn't represent the content correctly, hence leaves a misinterpretation to readers' minds. In this study, I aim to explore different types of headline incongruency problems, the challenges related to identifying and solving them computationally. The work is still under progress.
		  	</ul></li>
		  </li>
		  <li><h3>Exploring Informativeness of the Clickbait Headlines</h3>
		  	<ul>
		  		<li style="font-size: 18px">
		  			Many studies claimed that clickbait headlines deliberately conceal crucial information to attract readers. But the exact relationship between the level of clickbaity-ness and informativeness of the headline is still unexplored. This is an undergoing project where I want to exploit this gap of study.

	<div style="font-size: 18px">
		In future, I am planning to do the following tasks:
		<ul>
			<li>I will continue designing and implementing the ClaimViz project. After the initial phase, I will do a usability testing of the system by the fact-checkers.</li>
			<li>Headline Incongruency problem is my primary focus for the PhD proposal. I will explore this area more and try to come up with 1 or 2 computational solutions of this problem.</li>
			<li>For integrative paper, I am considering the informativeness of the clickbait headlines project. So, I will focus more on this project in the next 2 semesters.</li>
